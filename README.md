# Bookstore-Application

### Final project for Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design     

A single-window GUI based bookstore application that allows customers to purchase books and earn/redeem points. It also features an administrator management system that allows the admin to access two databases: the book inventory and the customer database. Admins have the ability to add, remove books and/or customers from the store with ease. 

The application follows Object Oriented Design principles and different software design patterns.
